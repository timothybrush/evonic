# MCP Client

Lets Evonic agents call tools on external [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) servers over stdio. Ships with a **Claude Code** preset (`claude mcp serve`), which exposes Claude Code's tools (Bash, Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, ...) to your agents.

## How it works

The plugin is fully self-contained: tool definitions live in `tools.json` (declared via `tools_file` in `plugin.json`) and their implementations under `backend/tools/`. It exposes two agent tools:

- **`mcp_list_tools(server?)`** — list the tools (name, description, input schema) exposed by one or all configured servers.
- **`mcp_call(server, tool, arguments, timeout_sec?)`** — invoke a tool on a server and return its text output.

Server subprocesses are spawned lazily on first use, shared across agents, kept alive between calls, restarted automatically if they die, and terminated when Evonic exits.

## Setup

1. Enable the **MCP Client** plugin in the Plugins UI.
2. Review `MCP_SERVERS` in the plugin settings. Format:

   ```json
   {
     "claude-code": {
       "command": "claude",
       "args": ["mcp", "serve"],
       "env": {},
       "cwd": "/path/to/project",
       "enabled": true
     }
   }
   ```

   - `command` (required): executable to spawn.
   - `args`, `env`: extra arguments / environment overrides.
   - `cwd`: working directory for the server. For `claude-code` this is the directory Claude Code operates in — **setting it is strongly recommended**.
   - `enabled`: set `false` to disable a server without deleting its entry.

3. Assign the `mcp_list_tools` and `mcp_call` tools to an agent in the agent's tool settings.

## Security

- Agents can only reference servers by *name*; commands, args, and env are admin-configured here and never come from the agent.
- `mcp_call` against `claude-code` executes commands on the host with the Evonic process's user and **bypasses Evonic's bash safety pipeline**. Only assign these tools to trusted agents.
