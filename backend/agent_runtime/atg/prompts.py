GRAPH_JSON_SCHEMA = """\
Output ONLY a single fenced ```json block with this exact shape:
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "n1",
      "goal": "one-sentence intent of this step",
      "tool": "read_file",

    }
  ]
}
Rules:
- The graph must be a DAG (no cycles). "deps" lists node ids that must finish first.
- An ATOMIC node performs exactly ONE tool call: set "tool" to a tool name and
  fill "args_template" with its arguments.
- If a step is too coarse for a single tool call, set "tool": null (a COMPOSITE
  node) — it will be refined into a subgraph later. Composite nodes still
  declare "outputs" (the interface they promise).
- Argument values may embed placeholders "${node_id.output_key}" that resolve
  to an upstream node's output at execution time. Every placeholder and every
  "inputs" entry must reference a node listed in "deps" and one of its
  declared "outputs".
- "outputs" is the node's declared interface: the output keys downstream nodes
  may consume. Use the tool's documented output keys.
- Keep goals concrete and self-contained; a worker will execute each node
  WITHOUT seeing the conversation."""
