"""Regression tests for mid-turn tool pruning in the agent tool loop.

Background
----------
``backend/agent_runtime/llm_loop.py`` prunes tools that have never been called
once an iteration threshold is crossed, to save tokens. The keep-decision was
originally a nested closure, and platform built-in tools (``remember`` /
``recall`` / ``recall_sessions`` / ``forget_memory``, CMP path navigation, the
state-machine gate, ``reset_active_model``, ...) were not exempted. They could
therefore be silently dropped from the schema sent to the LLM whenever they went
uncalled past the threshold -- even though the agent's SYSTEM.md mandates their
use. The fix exempts every platform built-in tool and lifts the decision into a
unit-testable module-level helper.
